% A practical work realizing the MPC algorithm       

About the Project - 
--------------------
This project is a practical project of Advanced methods for dynamic system control course.

Running the code - 
--------------------
Run the file "Test.m". 

Function files - 
--------------------
The file "MPC_matrices.m" is a function who generates the E and H matrices for MPC iteration. And the file "prediction.m" is used to predict the optimal inputs within the prediction horizon and then extracts the first u_k.
